*KEYB*
If you want something done, you've got to do it yourself, right? Wrong. 
Company resources are increasingly limited. And, as a manager, it?s possible you're constantly solicited and simply can't keep up. You know that teamwork and professional development are vital. So the next step to solving the resource crunch is delegation. Done properly, it's an asset to any organization. Sophie Lemieux?s workshop will explore the constraints and opportunities related to delegation. She'll teach you effective techniques and processes to mobilize employees and prepare them for their new responsibilities. The art of delegation is knowing how to control an outcome without falling into micromanagement and perfectionism and Sophie will show you how.

Today, data is a powerful asset for any organization. Data is literally everywhere and it is growing exponentially: 500 million tweets or 294 billion emails per day, 65 billion messages on WhatsApp, etc. This high volume, combined with the variety of sources (i.e., structured, unstructured, etc.) and the velocity or pace of the data generation brings multiple opportunities for value creation.

Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. 

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations. As Montreal is an international leader of Ethical AI initiatives and development of talent, it is more important now than ever for industry professionals to be aware of international legal regulations, ethical aspects of AI, and data privacy associated with both public and private, current and future data-related initiatives.

The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative.

Students work on a supervised team project to solve a complex interdisciplinary design
problem. The project is completed by a team of students from at least two different
departments in GCS. The project must provide clear goals for each discipline-specific task
and each student must have sufficient exposure to subjects in their program of study.
Student eligibility and project topics for this course are subject to approval by the ENGR
490 Design Committee, which includes a member from each department in GCS that
offers undergraduate programs. This committee vets each project to ensure the clarity and
scope of the goals and its relevance to the learning outcomes of students from each
discipline.
The project is carried out over both fall and winter terms. Students are expected to provide
a preliminary project proposal, a progress and a final report (as a group); take part in
group discussions in audit sessions during the design phase; and participate in a poster
session involving individual oral presentations at the end of the winter term. In addition to
the technical aspects, students are expected to learn how to evaluate their designs for
compliance to regulations, environmental and societal expectations and economic issues.
Students learn how to work in a multidisciplinary environment and receive exposure to
entrepreneurial skills. Lectures: one hour per week, two terms. Equivalent laboratory time:
three hours per week, two terms.

This project-based course will be taught over 4 weeks using multiple channels, including video tutorials on Udemy (up to 6 hours), Zoom lectures (4 hours), and weekly assignments. Components of your ePortfolio will be due incrementally so that, by the end of course, you will have a version of an ePortfolio that you can share with potential collaborators and/or employers. No previous Wordpress knowledge is required. 

Your ePortfolio is a personal website that encapsulates your work as a graduate student and early career professional. Think of it as an expanded CV. Whereas a CV ?tells? the reader of your achievements, the ePortfolio ?shows? the reader what you?ve done in detail. ePortfolio?s are increasingly requested in job applications since they summarize your skills and accomplishments in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. It is an opportunity to show your professional identity and maybe even be discovered! 

The ePortfolio for this course will contain the following pages: 
1.	About: a brief biographical statement
2.	Contact: a way to encourage correspondence 
3.	Projects: publications, multimedia/audiovisual works, media appearances, etc. 
4.	Optional pages for your education, research interests, extracurricular activities, etc.

This hybrid course spans 4 weeks with four 1-hour synchronous lectures over Zoom on Friday mornings. Between the weekly lectures, participants MUST consult recommended videos available through the Udemy workshop, ?Wordpress for Beginners - Master Wordpress Quickly? taught by Andrew Williams. These videos will cover essential information that will not be covered in the lectures but is key to building your ePortfolio. A Moodle site will also exist.

Given that graduate students investigate some of the most pressing issues in society, we must find ways to ensure that our work reaches the broader public. One way of doing this is to engage in op-ed writing. 

Op-eds are opinion pieces written on a newsworthy topic by someone that is unaffiliated with the newspaper. They enable you to bring your voice, expertise and authority on important issues to the greater public, in real-time.

In this 2-hour workshop we outline the key elements and strategies that contribute to writing powerful op-eds that journal editors will want to publish. First, we present the theory behind writing op-eds, including: what is an op-ed, what are news cycles, and how do the two fit together; the benefits of writing an op-ed; and analyze the components, structure, and style of an op-ed. During the second half of the session, participants will practice writing a news ?lede? and ?hook? (e.g., the key introductory components of an op-ed) that is relevant to their research field.

Research proposals vary tremendously between departments, research areas, and individuals, but there are also standard ways to present this material for each agency and scholarship program. Most fundamentally, this requires that all applicants read the program instructions carefully for the drafts they are creating.  For example, several programs require clear 1) background/introduction, 2) hypothesis/aims/objectives, 3) method/description, 4) Implications/Impact. This can often mean creating sub-headings within your proposal to explicitly identify and address each of these elements.

Note: Students are still ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they ultimately select. 
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to: 
?	Identify the key elements that are required within a research proposal, for a certain funding program under NSERC/FRQNT or CIHR/FRQS.
?	Format your proposal in such a way to highlight each of these essential items.
?	Draft a preliminary research proposal and send it out for appropriate peer-review and feedback.

Many grad students lack time. After all, it is our most valuable, finite resource. If you want to take control of your time, we highly recommend you take a little time for this workshop. The efficient use of your time will directly impact the quality of your work, your experience in graduate school and your job prospects after graduation.

This year many of us will be working in home environments and online. We will discuss unique approaches to staying productive and managing projects from informal workspaces.

In this workshop, participants will learn about tips and tools to prioritize your tasks, plan your time, minimize procrastination and distractions, and ultimately be more productive. We will explore tools such as the time management matrix, SMART framework, Pomodoro and Trello. The activities in this workshop provide space for you to plan your upcoming tasks while getting feedback from and learning from the experiences of other students.

Adopting the strategies for creating cohesive ideas, impactful statements, and a logical flow is crucial to any academic writing career. 

Applicable to graduate-level writers of all backgrounds, the Perfecting the Paragraph workshop aims to provide participants with an understanding of the most common mistakes that lead to unconvincing, unclear writing. Taking the paragraph as an ?idea? unit, the workshop looks at the formulation and purpose of the topic sentence. It then focuses on paragraph structure, development of the main  idea, transition to the next paragraph, punctuation, style, and vocabulary. 

***This workshop is particularly useful for non-native English speakers.***

This workshop takes place in two classes and will be accompanied by a moodle site. The first class will present theory. After the first class, participants will submit a writing sample via moodle for peer review. In a supportive environment, the instructor and students will provide feedback on the writing samples. In the second class we will discuss the learning of the peer review exercise. Participation in both days and the peer review activity is mandatory, and if unmet will result in the non-attendance penalty being applied.

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1) Identify the elements of the English academic paragraph
2) Examine the most common mistakes in paragraph composition
3)  Create a logical and easy-to-follow flow in their writing
4) Give and receive peer feedback on paragraph structure

Keeping up with readings, grading essays, hosting zoom sessions, facilitating discussions, organizing moodle sites, responding to student questions, and dealing with professors, TAs have a lot on their plate! To start the year right, the Centre for Teaching and Learning invites TAs from all Faculties, both new and returning, to attend an Orientation event.

This event will be an opportunity for TAs from across the university to: 
- be introduced to the resources and support available to them; 
- learn about their rights and responsibilities, and meet their union representative
- and join a community-of-practice of current TAs: an opportunity to share their questions, concerns, resources and reflections about their new role.

NOTE: This course is designed as a suitable elective for students following an undergraduate program. It has no formal prerequisites and will not qualify students to enrol for any other Mathematics course, and cannot be used to satisfy a Mathematics requirement in any BSc or BA program.
NOTE: Students who have received credit for INTE 215 or MATZ 215 may not take this course for credit.
